**Fun Fact:** If you are a developer then when you choose a technology depending on the time complexity, may be easier to implement or how fast the language/ technology is. But, in reality, most of the businesses, consider the time it takes to develop, why? because the lesser time it takes to develop the software, the less money it will cost. So, let's start with the main question **Why Python is Better & Why it is cost-effective to the business?**.

## Why Python is Better?
There are multiple reasons, on why python is better than other programming languages. So, let' discuss it one by one.

## 1. The Easy Learning Curve
Python is very simple and easy to adopt the technology. Because it has very much easy syntax like English. So, an example code can be -

```python
a = 4
b = 3

if a is b:
    print("Both are equal")
else:
    print("Both are not equal")
```

You see in the above line, it is how much easy. Even non-programmers who don't know python can see what is going on here. And this is the reason, school students learn programming in the python language because it is simple and fun.

From the business point of view, Python is easy to learn means it is easy to hire a python developer. Python code is easy to read, which means bugs will be fewer. So, the cost will be less. :)

## 2. Huge Community

One of the biggest reasons why python is better because it has a huge community on Reddit, StackOverflow, Quora, etc. During building any web app or mobile app or any type of software, it is obvious to see errors, bugs, etc.

Python has a huge community that means, if you search your error/problem, it is a higher chance that it is faced by other developers also, and you can get the solution how the developer solve the issue.

## 3. Python libraries
In any organization, time is the most valuable thing. You will see any companies trying to minimize the time. I already told you the reason in the beginning. So, if you write code for all the features of the app, it will take more time, plus more bugs occur, for example, authentication.

If you implement authentication on your own, bugs, security issues will be there. But, if you use any library to build it. Then it is less likely to have bugs because a whole community is writing and submitting bugs and solving the bugs for you.

Python has a pip library manager. It has hundreds of packages. You literally can search for any functionality you want, and you find a library for that. Your work will be less, companies' cost will be less. A win-win situation.

## 4. Big data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks
Currently, big data, data science, machine learning jobs are very hot topics in the industries and they will be last for at least 15-20 years also. So, most of the developers use python for that because it is convenient to use python. In python, the number has no max limit so big data problems will solve easily

It has many libraries like NumPy, pandas, sci-kit learn so that big data, data science jobs will be very much easy now with the help of python.

## 5. Automation
It is easy to guess that in the future most of the repetitive jobs are replaced by robots and automation. So, python has many automation libraries that you can use to do a repetitive job without human effort. Isn't it great?

## 6. Web Development

Python has two main web frameworks. Both are popular and ready to use in production. These are -

1. Django
1. Flask

Django is used for large applications and flask is used in small applications.

Both are easy to learn and support rapid development. So, that you can write code fast.

## Conclusion
You know that how python is used widely in all industries.
